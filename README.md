# Team-Penne
# Portfolio Analyzer

--- This is a jupyter-notebook-written analysis of an aggressively weighted portfolio including allocations in digital assets, small-cap stocks, mid-cap stocks, and large cap stocks.  The goal of the project is to create a portfolio that outperforms the S&P500 over a period of 20 years. Albeit without a sufficient amount of data for certain assets to make any real meaningful and reasonable analysis, our unique portfolio was able to meet our goal after running multiple Monte Carlo Simulations.

## Technologies

Jupyter Notebook is required for the analyzing_stocks.ipynb file to run. 

* (https://github.com/jupyter/notebook)

It is important to install JSON library, panel, sqlalchemy, MCForecastTools, os, alpaca trade api, requests library, pandas, dotenv, and matplotlib. 

### Required Libraries

```import os```
```import requests```
```import json```
```import pandas as pd```
```import hvplot.pandas```
```import panel as pn```
```import numpy as np```
```import sqlalchemy```
```from dotenv import load_dotenv```
```import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi```
```from MCForecastTools import MCSimulation```
```%matplotlib inline```
